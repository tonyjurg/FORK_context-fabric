# MCP Server

The Context-Fabric MCP (Model Context Protocol) server enables AI assistants like Claude to query corpora directly. This is functionality unique to Context-Fabric—it has no Text-Fabric equivalent.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources. Context-Fabric's MCP server exposes corpus operations as tools that AI assistants can invoke.

## Why Use the MCP Server?

- **Natural language queries**: Ask questions in plain English instead of writing code
- **Iterative exploration**: Refine queries conversationally based on results
- **No programming required**: Researchers can access corpus data without Python knowledge
- **AI-assisted analysis**: Let Claude help interpret patterns and suggest follow-up queries

## Getting Started

1. **Install**: `pip install context-fabric[mcp]`
2. **Configure**: Add to your Claude Desktop configuration
3. **Query**: Start asking questions about your corpus

See [Server Setup](/docs/mcp/guides/server-setup) for detailed installation instructions.

## Available Tools

The MCP server provides 11 tools organized into three categories:

### Discovery Tools
- `list_corpora` - List loaded corpora
- `describe_corpus` - Corpus structure overview
- `list_features` - Browse available features
- `describe_feature` - Feature details with sample values
- `get_text_formats` - Text encoding samples

### Search Tools
- `search` - Pattern-based search with multiple output modes
- `search_continue` - Paginate through results
- `search_csv` - Export results to CSV file
- `search_syntax_guide` - Query syntax documentation

### Data Access Tools
- `get_passages` - Retrieve text by section reference
- `get_node_features` - Batch feature lookup
