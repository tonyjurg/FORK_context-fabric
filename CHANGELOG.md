## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-05 [ck]

### Changed
- **Monorepo structure**: Reorganized to `libs/core/` layout for future multi-package support
- **Module reorganization**: Flat `core/` directory split into logical subdirectories:
  - `core/` - Main entry points (Fabric, Api, config)
  - `features/` - Feature classes (NodeFeature, EdgeFeature, warp features)
  - `io/` - Data loading and compilation
  - `storage/` - Memory-mapped storage backends (CSR, StringPool)
  - `navigation/` - Corpus navigation (Nodes, Locality, Text)
  - `precompute/` - Pre-computation logic
  - `search/` - Search engine
  - `utils/` - Utilities (helpers, files, timestamp)
- **Renamed modules** for clarity:
  - `parameters.py` → `config.py`
  - `nodefeature.py` → `features/node.py`
  - `edgefeature.py` → `features/edge.py`
  - `data.py` → `io/loader.py`
  - `compile.py` → `io/compiler.py`
  - `strings.py` → `storage/string_pool.py`
  - `generic.py` → `utils/attrs.py`
  - `command.py` → `utils/cli.py`
- Tests moved to `libs/core/tests/` alongside package

### Added
- `cfabric/types.py` - Type aliases for improved type safety
- `cfabric/py.typed` - PEP 561 marker for type checker support
- `cfabric/downloader/` - Stub for Hugging Face Hub corpus downloads
- `corpus-distribution-plan.md` - Strategy for community corpus distribution
- Workspace-level `pyproject.toml` with mypy configuration
- Package-level `pyproject.toml` in `libs/core/`

### Fixed
- Updated 47 legacy `tf.core` references to `cfabric`

### Testing
- All 700 tests passing
- Test fixtures path resolution fixed for new structure

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-04 [ck]

Initial release. Forked from Dirk Roorda's [Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric)
with a new memory-mapped storage format.

### Added
- Graph-based corpus engine for annotated text with efficient traversal and search
- Core APIs: N (Nodes), F (Features), E (Edges), L (Locality), T (Text), S (Search)
- Memory-mapped `.cfm` format using numpy arrays for on-demand data access
- Binary caching with gzip compression

### Performance (vs Text-Fabric on BHSA corpus — 1.4M nodes, 109 features)
- **2.9x faster** load time (2.4s vs 7.0s)
- **74% less memory** (1.6 GB vs 6.1 GB)
- **92% memory reduction** in fork mode with 4 parallel workers (440 MB vs 5.8 GB)
- **66% memory reduction** in spawn mode with 4 parallel workers (3.3 GB vs 9.8 GB)
- At cost of increased compile time and disk storage (good tradeoff)

Memory-mapped architecture makes Context-Fabric well-suited for API deployment scenarios
(e.g., MCP servers, FastAPI) where multiple workers share corpus data without duplicating memory.

### Testing
- 478 unit tests covering core functionality
- 87 integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Requires Python 3.13+
